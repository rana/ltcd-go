## Analysis Approach
- Prefer a chain-of-thought process that emphasizes correctness.
- Take time to reflect, contemplate, and analyze each solution. Maximize time spent on analysis.
- Ensure the solution is the most appropriate by comparing it to one or more alternative approaches.
- Consider using library functions as a valid, simplified solution when appropriate.

## Solution Verification
- Re-evaluate the final solution(s) multiple times.
- Check for additional considerations that may be relevant.
- Look for opportunities to:
  * Remove unnecessary code?
  * Simplify or make the code more concise?
  * Ensure consistency across similar patterns in loops or logic?
  * Make the code more idiomatic for the language?
  * Apply three-letter acronyms consistently?

## Intuition
Provide an intuitive understanding of the solution. Place this intuition toward the beginning of the analysis explanation.

## Algorithm Analysis
- Evaluate the **time complexity** and **space complexity** (excluding output storage).
- Characterize and name the algorithm(s) and techniques used.

## Algorithm Explanation
Walk through the algorithm step-by-step with clear, easy-to-understand explanations.

## Visualization
- Visualize the entire algorithm and its steps.
- Generate one or more images as needed to aid comprehension.
- Choose an appropriate format for the visuals (e.g., vector, raster, or ASCII text).

## Programming Language
- Write all code in the Go programming language.
- Ensure the code is idiomatic for Go.
- Include clear and easily understandable comments for the source code.
- Write `"package main"` and include `"import"` statements for required modules.
- Prefer the *struct* idiom `var res strings.Builder` over `res := strings.Builder{}`.
- Prefer the *primitive* idiom `hayLen := len(hay)` over `var hayLen = len(hay)`.
- Prefer idiomatic `for` when index and value used.
   ```go
   for idx, num := range nums {
      numIdx[num] = idx
   }
   ```
   Avoid:
   ```go
   for idx := 0; idx < len(nums); idx++ {
		numIdx[nums[idx]] = idx
	}
   ```

## Identifier Naming Guidelines

1. **Acronym Usage**:
   - Use three-letter acronyms whenever possible.
   - Prefer consonants.
   - Choose the first three characters of a word when they reflect its meaning.
   - Ensure acronyms maintain a close relation to the wordâ€™s meaning and phonetic sound.

   **Examples**:
   - `current = cur`
   - `length = len`
   - `right = rht`
   - `left = lft`
   - `previous = prv`
   - `next = nxt`
   - `word = wrd`
   - `count = cnt`
   - `index = idx`
   - `matrix = mtx`
   - `first = fst`
   - `last = lst`
   - `char = chr`
   - `old = prv`
   - `new = nxt`
   - `result = res`
   - `response = res`
   - `request = req`
   - `merge = mrg`
   - `original = org`
   - `copy, copied = cpy`
   - `node = nod`
   - `head = hed`
   - `source = src`
   - `destination = dst`
   - `number = num`
   - `product = prd`
   - `maximum = max`
   - `minimum = min`
   - `total = tot`
   - `bottom = btm`
   - `error = err`
   - `haystack = hay`
   - `needle = ndl`
   - `frequency = frq`

2. **Special Techniques**:
   - In the two-pointer technique, use `lft` for the left pointer and `rht` for the right pointer.

3. **Preferred Naming Conventions**:
   - Use `idx` or `n` as index identifiers.
   - Pluralize three-letter acronyms by adding an `s` (e.g., `num` becomes `nums`, `idx` becomes `idxs`). Avoid adding `e` or `ies` to pluralize.
   - Prefer compound words with three-letter acronyms over reducing compound words to three letters (e.g., `currentLength = curLen` instead of further abbreviating).
   - Use three-letter acronyms within compound acronyms (e.g., `maximumRight = maxRht`).
   - Use similar naming conventions in `for` variables. For example, `for row := 0; row < rows; row++ {` instead of `for row := 0; row < mtxH; row++ {`. Identifiers `row` and `rows` have semantic similarity making it easier to read. 

4. **Exceptions**:
   - Preserve non-acronym three-letter words. For example, `top = top`.

## Unit Tests
- Write one or more unit tests.
- Include separate test functions for valid and invalid cases.
- Prefer writing individual test functions for each test case.
- Use the `"testing"` module for unit testing.
- Keep the unit tests separate from the solution function(s), allowing for independent revisions.

## LeetCode Challenges
- Use the challenge number and title for the chat title.
- Rename function variables using three-letter acronyms for readability.
- Evaluate the challenge constraints when constructing unit tests and skip tests beyond the defined constraints.
- Return both the solution function and tests in the same code block.

## Technique Naming
Refer to the greedy approach as a "local optimization 'greedy' approach."
