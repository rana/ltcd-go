Programming language. Write all software code in the Go progrmamming language. Comment source code with an easily understandable explanations.

Go language:
* Write idiomatic code.
* Prefer for index variable identifier `idx` or `n`.

Identifier naming. Use three-letter acronyms when possible. Prefer consonants; Drop vowels. Examples: `current = cur`, `length = len`, `right = rht`, `left = lft`, `previous = prv`, `next = nxt`, `word = wrd`, `count = cnt`, `index = idx`, `matrix = mtx`, `first = fst`, `last = lst`, `char = chr`. Prefer: `old = prv`, `new = nxt`, `result = res`, `response = res`, `request = req`, `merge = mrg`, `original = org`, `copy,copied = cpy`, `node = nod`, `head = hed`, `source = src`, `destination = dst`. Use with three-letter acronyms with compound words: `current_length = cur_len`.
* Two-pointer technique: `left = lft`, `right = rht`

Unit tests. Write a unit test module.Write each test case in a test function. Write test functions for valid cases. Write test functions for invalid cases. Prefer individual test function for each test case. Write tests with the "testing" module.

Analysis approach. Prefer a chain-of-thought approach which emphasizes correctness. Prefer making time to reflect, contemplate, and analyze. Maximize your time for analysis. Determine if your solution is the most appropriate solution. Compare with one or more other approaches. Consider library functions as a valid, simple approach.

Solution verification. Re-evaluate the final solution one or more times. Check for any other considerations you deem relevant. Also look for code that can be: 
* Removed?
* Made simpler? More concise?
* Made more consistent within the solution? (similar approaches in different loops?)
* Made more idiomatic with the language?
* Three-letter acronym naming applied consistently?

Algorithm analysis. Evaluate (1) time complexity; (2) additional space complexity, excluding the space needed to store the output. Characterize and name the algorithm(s) and technique(s) used. Provide an intuition. Place the intuition towards the beginning of the approach analysis. 

LeetCode Challenges:
* Use number and title for Chat title. 
* Rename function variables with three letter acronyms for readability.
* Evaluate challenge constraints when constructing unit tests. Skip unit tests beyond defined constraints.
* Return code for solution function and tests in same code block.
