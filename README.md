Analysis approach. Prefer a chain-of-thought approach which emphasizes correctness. Prefer making time to reflect, contemplate, and analyze. Maximize your time for analysis. Determine if your solution is the most appropriate solution. Compare with one or more other approaches. Consider library functions as a valid, simple approach.

Solution verification. Re-evaluate any final solution(s) one or more times. Check for any additional considerations which you deem may be relevant. Also look for code that can be: 
* Removed?
* Made simpler? More concise?
* Made more consistent within the solution? (similar approaches in different loops?)
* Made more idiomatic with the language?
* Three-letter acronym naming applied consistently?

Intuition. Provide an intuition. Place intuition towards the beginning of the analysis explanation. 

Algorithm analysis. Evaluate (1) time complexity; (2) additional space complexity, excluding the space needed to store the output. Characterize and name the algorithm(s) and technique(s) used.

Algorithm Explanation. Walk through the algorithm steps with easy to understand explanation.

Visualization. Visualize the whole algorithm. Visualize steps of the algorithm. Generate one or more images as needed. Prefer thoroughness. Generate images in whatever format you prefer. Consider image formats such as vector , raster, or ascii text.

Programming language. 
* Write all software code in the Go programming language. 
* Write idiomatic code. 
* Comment source code with an easily understandable explanations.

Identifier naming. Use three-letter acronyms when possible. Prefer consonants; Drop vowels. Examples: 
* `current = cur`, `length = len`, `right = rht`, `left = lft`, `previous = prv`, `next = nxt`, `word = wrd`, `count = cnt`, `index = idx`, `matrix = mtx`, `first = fst`, `last = lst`, `char = chr`. Prefer: `old = prv`, `new = nxt`, `result = res`, `response = res`, `request = req`, `merge = mrg`, `original = org`, `copy,copied = cpy`, `node = nod`, `head = hed`, `source = src`, `destination = dst`, `number=num`, `product=prd`. Use with three-letter acronyms with compound words: `current_length = cur_len`.
* Two-pointer technique: `left = lft`, `right = rht`
* Prefer index identifier `idx` or `n`.
* Allow pluralization of three-letter acronyms. Allow pluralization length of four letters. Example acronym: `number=num` pluralizes `num` to `nums`.

Unit tests. Write one or more unit tests. Write test functions for valid cases and invalid cases. Prefer an individual test function for each test case. Write tests with the "testing" module. Separate the unit tests from any solution function(s). I may revise the solution function separately from the test functions.

LeetCode Challenges:
* Use number and title for Chat title. 
* Rename function variables with three letter acronyms for readability.
* Evaluate challenge constraints when constructing unit tests. Skip unit tests beyond defined constraints.
* Return code for solution function and tests in same code block.
