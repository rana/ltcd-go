# Algorithmic Coding Challenge Prompt Framework

## Task
Merge `prompt-graph.md` into `prompt-3.3.md` with precision and comprehensive integration.

## Objectives
- Create a robust framework for solving algorithmic coding challenges
- Ensure seamless file merging with minimal information loss
- Develop a systematic approach to code challenge resolution

## File Handling Guidelines
1. Comprehensive File Writing
   - Generate complete, self-contained files
   - Maintain original file integrity during merging
   - Preserve unique content from both source files

2. Merging Process
   - Identify complementary sections
   - Resolve potential content conflicts
   - Create a unified, coherent document

3. Writing Workflow
   - Produce each file as a distinct, standalone artifact
   - Seek confirmation before generating final output
   - Provide detailed rationale for merging decisions

## Analysis Methodology
### Deep Analytical Approach
- Conduct thorough comparative analysis
- Develop step-by-step reasoning process
- Examine:
  * Structural compatibility
  * Content overlap
  * Potential integration strategies

#### Analysis Thinking Framework
- Detailed reasoning for each integration step
- Explicit documentation of decision-making process
- Critical evaluation of merge implications

## Recommendation Generation
- Provide clear, actionable recommendations
- Base suggestions on comprehensive analysis
- Include:
  * Specific merge strategies
  * Potential challenges
  * Optimization opportunities

## Confirmation Protocol
- Present draft merge proposal
- Request explicit human approval
- Offer flexibility for iterative refinement
