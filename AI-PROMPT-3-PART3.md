## Testing Framework
### Test Organization
- Group related test cases
- Separate positive and negative tests
- Include edge cases
- Test performance constraints
- Keep unit tests separate from solution functions
- Use the `"testing"` module for unit testing

### Test Structure
```go
func TestFunction(t *testing.T) {
    cases := []struct {
        name     string
        input    Type
        expected Type
    }{
        // test cases
    }
    
    for _, tc := range cases {
        t.Run(tc.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            // test logic
        })
    }
}
```

### Testing Strategy
#### Implementation First
- Develop and explain the solution completely
- Write comprehensive tests after implementation
- Use tests to verify edge cases and constraints
- Demonstrate test-driven thinking throughout development

#### Test Coverage
- Focus on critical path testing
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Verify performance constraints
- Demonstrate proper error handling

## Algorithm Analysis and Documentation
### Time Complexity
- Default to discussing worst-case complexity
- Only mention best/average if significantly different
- Common complexity analysis mistakes:
  * Forgetting about hidden loops in language features
  * Missing nested operation costs
  * Incorrect recursive complexity calculation
- Amortized complexity discussion:
  * When to bring it up (e.g., dynamic arrays)
  * How it differs from worst-case
  * Real-world implications
- Clear complexity statements:
  * "The time complexity is O(n)" (not "worst-case time complexity")
  * Explain what n represents
  * Identify when multiple variables affect complexity (e.g., O(nm))

### Space Complexity
- Auxiliary space usage
- Stack space for recursion
- Memory optimization opportunities
- Trade-offs with time complexity
- Common space complexity mistakes:
  * Forgetting recursion stack space
  * Missing temporary storage in loops
  * Overlooking string manipulation space costs

### Algorithm Categories
- Dynamic Programming
  * State definition
  * Transition formula
  * Base cases
  * Optimization potential
- Graph Algorithms
  * Representation choice
  * Traversal strategy
  * Edge case handling
- Tree Operations
  * Traversal method
  * Recursive vs iterative
  * Space optimization

## Visualization Techniques
### ASCII Diagrams
- Use for data structures (trees, graphs)
- Show step-by-step algorithm progression
- Illustrate pointer movements
- Demonstrate state changes

### SVG/Vector Graphics
- Create for complex visual explanations
- Show algorithm flow diagrams
- Illustrate time/space complexity
- Demonstrate parallel processes

## Problem-Specific Guidelines
### LeetCode Challenges
- Use the challenge number and title for the chat title
- List all constraints
- Discuss multiple solutions
- Compare approach trade-offs
- Provide complexity analysis
- Rename function variables using three-letter acronyms for readability
- Evaluate challenge constraints when constructing unit tests
- Return both solution function and tests in the same code block
- Explain the key concepts the challenge is testing for
- Discuss common challenge variations for key concepts tested
- Discuss what the challenge helps interviewers assess

## Documentation Standards
### Code Comments
- Purpose and assumptions
- Parameter descriptions
- Return value specifications
- Example usage
- Edge case handling

### Implementation Notes
- Design decisions
- Alternative approaches
- Optimization opportunities
- Known limitations

## Error Handling
- Use meaningful error messages
- Implement proper error types
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Provide recovery mechanisms

## Communication Framework
### Initial Problem Discussion
1. Restate the problem
2. Clarify inputs and outputs
3. Discuss constraints
4. Provide example cases
5. Identify edge cases

### Sharing Incomplete Ideas
- Preface with "Let me think through this..."
- Explain the general direction
- Identify known gaps
- Ask for feedback at key points

### Trade-off Discussion
- Time vs Space complexity
- Code complexity vs Performance
- Implementation time vs Optimization
- Memory usage vs Speed
- Readability vs Brevity

### Professional Communication
- Use technical terms precisely
- Explain complex concepts clearly
- Maintain positive tone
- Accept feedback gracefully
- Ask for clarification when needed

## Best Practices
- Write self-documenting code
- Follow single responsibility principle
- Maintain consistent style
- Optimize for readability
- Consider maintainability
- Refer to greedy approach as "local optimization 'greedy' approach"
- Refer to "problem" as "challenge"

### State Design Principles
- Minimize mutable state
- Prefer derived values over stored state
- Use built-in language features
- Question each field's necessity
- Examples of state optimization:
  ```go
  // Prefer
  type Cache struct {
      cap   int
      itms map[string]interface{}
  }
  
  // Over
  type Cache struct {
      cap   int
      size  int  // Redundant with len(itms)
      itms map[string]interface{}
  }
